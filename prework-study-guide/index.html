        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HMTL) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is used to create the structure of a webpage and is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Text Elements</li>
            <li>Image Elements</li>
            <li>Header Elements</li>
            <li>List Elements</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers. Some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page are:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Meta-Related Elements</li>
            <li>Content Division Elements</li>
            <li>Semantic Elements</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When building a website, we first use HTML to build a sturdy frame using HTML elements as "building blocs".</li>
            <li>Then we add CSS to define the style.</li>
            <li>Finally we add JavaScript to our HTML structure to make the website interactive.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>When we create the structure of a webpage, we use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
            <li>These tags contain everything that we need/want to include in the element.</li>
            <li>This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The &lthead&gt element contains information, or metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included in the &lthead&gt element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
            <li>The &ltbody&gt element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>The &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt is not case-senstive because it is a declaration.</li>
            <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive but HTML elements are.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>The &lthtml&gt opening tag represents the root, or start of the HTML document. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML attritbutes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>The &lthead&gt opening element contains the metadata for a web application. Metadata is data about a webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines and performance.
            Inside the &lthead&gt element, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The &lttitle&gt element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for SEO.</li>
              <li>The &ltstyle&gt element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The &ltbase&gt element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The &ltlink&gt element connects an externall resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The &ltmeta&gt element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
              <li>The &ltscript&gt element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called "Child Elements". The element that holds all the children is known as the "Parent Element".</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The &ltbody&gt element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the &ltbody&gt element.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The &ltbody&gt element is an example of a "Semantic" HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Where possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements because they make HTML easier to ready by other developers and the browser.</li>
              <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure a webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>Not all elements are semantic. It is common to see non-semantic elements such as &ltdiv&gt to create a division in the page, or &ltspan&gt to create an inline division.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem.</li>
              <li>The most important thing to remember is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whereever possible, especially when the content is visible to others.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening and closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
              <li>We insert the content between an opening and closing tag so the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably in the web development industry, but it is important to know the difference.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An "element" refers to the entire element from opening to closing tag.</li>
              <li>A "tag" refers to only what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, &lth4&gt, &lth5&gt and &lth6&gt elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Order Matters! When using headings it is important that we use heading tags in order from &lth1&gt to &lth6&gt to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices.</li>
              <li>In addition, the biggest heading &lth1&gt should only appear once on each page.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The &ltp&gt element represent a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The &ltul&gt, &ltol&gt and &ltli&gt elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists and list items. In essence these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The &ltimg&gt element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The &ltimg&gt element can contain various attributes; the "src" attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
              <li>The "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The &ltbr&gt element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The &lta&gt element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or webpages.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The "href" attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS</li>
            <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet</li>
            <li>External CSS Style Sheet</li>
          </ul>
          <li>When a developer want to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use "inline CSS"</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
            <li>This is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than "external CSS" and "internal CSS" style sheets. This is because each inline style must be edited individually whenever a design change is made.</li>
            <li>An example of "inline CSS" is using the &ltstyle&gt attribute to change the colour of a single &lth1&gt heading.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using a &ltstyle&gt element in the &lthead&gt element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rule for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a &ltlink&gt element placed in the HTML's &lthead&gt element.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Seperation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to seperating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Seperation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Diagram Of A CSS Rule: <br>
            div {color: blue; test-align: justify;}</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"div" = Selector </li>
              <li>"color" and "text-align" = Property</li>
              <li>"blue" and "justify" = Value</li>
              <li>"color: blue" and "text-align: justify" = Declarations</li>
              <li>"color: blue; text-align: justify;" = Declaration Block</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations apply.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The CSS property we want to apply.</li>
              <li>The value of the property.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The "margin" property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A "margin" property indicates how much space we want outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer.</li>
              <li>When setting the "margin" property as 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The "padding" property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>When increasing padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding while transparent is located inside the element whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>The CSS Box Model:<br>
              To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.
              This is referred to as the CSS Box Model:
              <br>
              <br>
            <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/5ef2084faaf0ac46dc9c10be_06_23_2020/box_model.png" id="boxmodel" alt="CSS Box Model" />
            <br>
              Sometimes we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>To do this, we use a special wild card symbol, or "*".</li>
                <br>
              </ul>
              <li>"Do Not Repeat Yourself" (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
                <br>
              </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication and so much more!</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Everytime you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data or fill in a form, JavaScript is at work.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a website. This happens in games, in the behaviour of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation etc.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is versatile, beginner friendly and is relatively compact, yet flexible.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers have written a cariety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You should start by declaring a variable with the "let" keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>"let myVariable;"</li>
            <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to seperate statements on a single line.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means "myVariable" is not the same as "myvariable".</li>
            <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value. This can be done on both the same or seperate lines of code. The value of a variable can also be changed later within a piece of coding</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Data Types:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>String:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks - '   '.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Number:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a number. Numbers dont have quotes around them.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Boolean:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a "True/False" value. The words "true" and "false" are special keywords that don't require any quote marks.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Array:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
            <li>Example: <br>
                "let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10];"<br>
                Refer to each member of the array like this: <br>
                "myVariable[0]" and "myVariable[1]"</li>
              <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Object:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a Variable.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anuthing dynamic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Comments:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This can be done by "/* COMMENT */" or "//COMENT".</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Operators:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Addition:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
            <li>"+"</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>These perform just as expected in normal basic maths.</li>
            <li>"-"  "*"  "/"</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Assignment:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This assigns value to a variable.</li>
            <li>"="</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Strict Equality:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
            <li> "==="</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <li>Not, Does-Not-Equal:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li>
            <li>"!"   "!=="</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Control Flow:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom and order counts!</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interupted with the use of conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Arrays:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declare a variable with only one data item.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Being able to store a group of data in an array is a fundamental feature of JavaScript.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>They are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
