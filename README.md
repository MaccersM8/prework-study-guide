# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The motivation was to build and design a webpage where a student can easily read all the notes taken during the prework phase of the bootcamp. Due to the intense nature of a bootcamp, students typically find that there notes are scattered with little or no cohesion. This means that when referring back to previous notes, students find it difficult to easily locate the information they need. To overcome this problem, a webpage has been designed to store and display notes from key topics that students can easily read and have access to when needed. Throughout this project, I have learnt how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to structure, design and give functionality to the webpage as well as using Git techniques and commands to update the remote repository.

## Usage

The webpage has four sections:
HTML
CSS
Git
JavaScript
These are the main four topics where bootcamp students will need to refer back to previous notes that have been made.
Within each section, there will be some notes for each of the topics that I have learnt throughout going through the prework phase of the bootcamp. In some of the sections I have used extra headings to organise the notes better as well as including diagrams where needed.

If you was to access the console, there will some JavaScript coding which will indicate to a user which topic to study first.
